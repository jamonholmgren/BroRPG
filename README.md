# BroRPG (working title)

Browser-based RPG that I'm building with my brothers Drew, Lucas, Shane, Denton, and Blair, and my son Cedric.

## Getting started

[Install git](https://gitforwindows.org/) (already included in macOS) and then from Terminal (macOS) or Git Bash (Windows) clone down the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:jamonholmgren/BroRPG.git
```

CD into it:

```
cd BroRPG
```

[Install python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (already included in macOS), then start a webserver from the folder:

```
python3 -m http.server
```

Open this link in your web browser:
